# Admin Dashboard & S3 URL Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Admin Dashboard View/Download Not Working
**Problem**: Clicking view or download buttons in admin dashboard was just refreshing the window.

**Root Cause**: Frontend was making requests with `responseType: "blob"` but backend was returning HTTP 302 redirects to S3 URLs, which doesn't work with blob response type.

**Solution**:
- Updated backend endpoints to return JSON responses with S3 URLs instead of redirects
- Modified frontend to use direct S3 URLs from document data
- Added new endpoints: `/admin/documents/{id}/view`, `/admin/documents/{id}/share`

### 2. Share URL Showing Localhost Instead of Direct S3 URLs
**Problem**: Share functionality was generating localhost server URLs instead of direct S3 cloud URLs.

**Root Cause**: Share endpoint was only returning server-controlled URLs for access control.

**Solution**:
- Modified share endpoint to return both server URL and direct S3 URL
- Updated ShareModal to prefer direct S3 URLs for better performance
- Added `directUrl` and `s3Url` fields to share responses

### 3. Missing S3 URLs in Admin Documents Response
**Problem**: Admin documents list didn't include direct S3 URLs for immediate access.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced admin documents endpoint to include `s3Url` and `directUrl` fields
- Added proper field mapping in document response objects
- Ensured all document fields are properly populated

## Configuration Requirements

### S3 Bucket Setup
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::document-sharing-system/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Application Properties
```properties
aws.s3.bucket-name=document-sharing-system
aws.s3.region=ap-south-1
aws.access-key-id=YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
aws.secret-access-key=YOUR_SECRET_KEY
```

## Testing Instructions

1. **Start the Application**
   ```bash
   cd springapp
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

2. **Test Admin Dashboard**
   - Navigate to admin dashboard
   - Click view/download/share buttons on documents
   - Verify direct S3 URLs are working

3. **Test Share Functionality**
   - Share a document from regular user interface
   - Verify both server and direct URLs are generated
   - Test access with different permission levels

4. **Use Test Page**
   - Open `test-s3-urls.html` in browser
   - Run all test scenarios
   - Verify S3 connectivity and URL generation

## Expected Behavior

### Admin Dashboard
- ✅ View button opens document in new tab
- ✅ Download button downloads file directly
- ✅ Share button copies S3 URL to clipboard
- ✅ No more window refreshing issues

### Document Sharing
- ✅ Share URLs are direct S3 cloud links
- ✅ No localhost URLs in production
- ✅ Optimal performance with direct access
- ✅ Proper access level enforcement

### S3 Integration
- ✅ 100% cloud-based file storage
- ✅ Direct URL generation for all documents
- ✅ Public read access for shared documents
- ✅ Secure file upload and management

## Troubleshooting

### If S3 URLs Don't Work
1. Check S3 bucket policy allows public read access
2. Verify bucket name and region in application.properties
3. Ensure AWS credentials are valid
4. Test direct S3 access using the test page

### If Admin Dashboard Still Refreshes
1. Clear browser cache and cookies
2. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
3. Verify backend endpoints are returning JSON responses
4. Test with different browsers

### If Share URLs Show Localhost
1. Restart the Spring Boot application
2. Check that share endpoint returns directUrl field
3. Verify ShareModal is using the correct URL preference
4. Test share functionality with the test page
